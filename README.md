# Simple Keylogger

The Simple Keylogger is a lightweight Python application designed to monitor and log keystrokes on a user's system. This project serves educational purposes, demonstrating basic concepts in Python programming, file handling, and keyboard event listening using the pynput library.

## Features

- Keystroke Logging: Records all keystrokes, including special keys (e.g., space, enter, shift).
- File Output: Saves logged keystrokes to a local text file (keyfile.txt).
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pynput library
- Visual Studio Code


#### Note: Input Monitoring from Privacy and Security Settings for Visual Studio Code should be enabled to allow monitoring user input from your keyboard
